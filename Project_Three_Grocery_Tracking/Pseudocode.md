	Read file line by line, and capitalize every line, product.		// (Function: capitilize())
	Push read product into a storage vector.						// (Function: addSoldProduct())
		If product doesn’t yet exist in the vector:
			Set object, and add to the vector.
		Else, increment object’s quantity by one.					// (Class Function: AddItemsSold())
